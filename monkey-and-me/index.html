<p>Dear diary,</p>

<p>My hands are still shaking as I’m writing this. The most funniest thing happened today. Funny, scary… all combined together. Don’t know if there’s any single word to describe this feeling. Whatever it is, this is one day I am never going to forget.</p>

<p>You know that I am an animal lover; I have never been scared of animals. So today at college when we spotted a small monkey on one of the trees in the park, it wasn’t a big thing. The little guy was just sitting there; none of us paid any attention to it. That may also be because we were busy making plans about going for a movie.</p>

<p>We were sitting just outside the park in the common area. There is no closed boundary for the park; just small bushes all along the side. The step on which we were sitting was really low; so it was almost like we were sitting on the floor. Four of us were sitting, three standing. I was sitting closest to the park, leaning against a pillar.</p>

<p>Suddenly we hear some commotion and everyone starts moving out from the park. Someone had informed the security guards and they were trying to drive the monkey out by throwing sticks at the tree.
“That is so cruel; what if the stick hits the monkey? It’s not right.”
“Stick won’t hit yaar, the monkey is way too high up.”
“Still… it will get scared na. It’s so small.”
I was voicing my feeling for the monkey. Poor thing, what it must be going through. One of my friends supported me.
“Haan yaar, animals are very sensitive; unless you hurt them, they won’t hurt you.”
“Haan, exactly. They are more humane than humans. Now see, if the guards hit the monkey, it won’t do anything. For one, it is too small. Two, it’s alone and scared now, so it won’t even go near humans. Anyway I think they are wasting their time; nothing is going to happen.”
I didn’t want to watch, so I turned my attention to putting on my scarf. It was slightly cold even though it was just after noontime.
Suddenly my friend shouted,
“Arey… it’s coming this side. Chalo, chalo.”
“What!? It’s in the tree na; it won’t come down.”
“No, no. Chalo&hellip; bhaago&hellip; bhaag.”
I looked up to see my friends running. I leaned back to look towards the park. (The pillar was blocking my view).
The monkey was only one-arm distance away from me.
It was running and it was angry. It took only a split second to figure that out. The next second I turned my head. Thank God that I did. Thank God for sensible decisions even when your mind shuts down. Because if I hadn’t, I can’t imagine what would have happened. (And where I would be now).
Just as I turned, the monkey jumped on me. I felt its hand on my shoulder. I jumped up and ran. I tried to shake it off. Don’t know how that would have been possible, but I was trying. I was shaking my head and my body. I think one of its hands got stuck in my hair (which I had decided to tie in a pony today). I started turning around. Then suddenly the weight was off my shoulder&hellip; the monkey was down. I turned… and it jumped right back onto my leg… almost like clutching me for dear life. I had been screaming the entire time (this part of the story is as narrated by my friends… because I don’t remember a thing), but now my screams became louder. I started kicking my leg… (like against an imaginary football.. just to give you a picture of what the scene would have looked like), but the monkey refused to let go. I was jumping and running all at the same time. I felt the monkey’s grip loosening a little, and then…. it jumped off of me.
I didn’t wait to think. I ran in the direction I had seen few of my friends running – towards the canteen. I didn’t know if the monkey was following me, but the thought made me run faster. As I reached the canteen, someone opened the glass door; I got in and they immediately shut it.
“Are you okay?”
“You aren’t hurt na?”
Everyone started asking questions. I sat down and pulled out my hair band. I think I wanted to make sure there was nothing in my hair.
“I am fine.” I could manage to say only so much.
Someone gave me a bottle of water; water has never tasted so sweet before. I washed my face and I felt the heat reducing. All the excitement and running had made me feel like my face would explode.
After a while as the situation calmed down, (as I calmed down), we came to know that the guards had been successful in getting the monkey out of the college compound without hurting it… or hurting anyone else.
Soon we joined with the other friends who had run off in the other direction and picked up our bags and books. We didn’t have class for yet another half an hour, so the seven of us went to the parking lot&hellip; far away from the incident zone. Everyone started telling the story from their point of view. The whole incident – from the monkey jumping on me till it got off – it had lasted for only 40-45 seconds.
“Whaaat!? No way. No, no.” I couldn’t believe it.
“Yes&hellip; really. By the time we reached the canteen, the monkey had got off your back.”
“Oh my goodness&hellip; it seemed like so long.” (I still believe it was a longer time).
“We were standing right there, but we didn’t know what to do. The security was shouting something; I think he was asking you to stop jumping.
“We are so sorry we ran away, we got scared.”
“It’s okay&hellip; it’s ok, no problem. Even I would have done the same.”
We all laughed. (But seriously, I would have done the same; I would have ran)
Only about twenty people had witnessed the whole thing. One of our classmates came by.
“Were you the one the monkey attacked?”
I laughed. “Yes, that’s me.”
“Oh my, thank God you are okay.”
“Yes, yes. The sweater did a good job.”
Just saying those words send a shiver through me. If it hadn’t been winter, and if I hadn’t been wearing the thick sweater… I don’t know how things would have ended. Monkeys attacking people is common news now a days. But I hadn’t thought of this incident as an attack until she actually asked me.
“Yes, I am perfectly fine.”
We walked to class. The story had spread and we could hear others animatedly talking about it in the classroom.
“You know… one huge monkey attacked one of the students and she is very badly hurt.”
We started laughing. It was fun to watch their faces as they came to know it was me.
I was laughing too… and it did me good. Soon I started relaxing. (On the outside I was already acting very calm but on the inside had been shivering). Now I could feel my breathing… it was normal again. ☺</p>

<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>

<h2 id="heading-in-body-copy">Heading in Body Copy</h2>

<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.</p>

<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>

<h3 id="subheading-in-body-copy">Subheading in Body Copy</h3>

<p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
<li>Unordered list item

<ul>
<li>Nested unordered list item</li>
<li>Nested unordered list item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
</ul>

<p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.</p>
