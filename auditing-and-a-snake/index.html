<p>It was a snake!”</p>

<p>“What!? Here!? In the city!? A snake!?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she saw it. Said it was a ‘vellikettan’ – a small snake with white stripes across.”</p>

<p>“Vellikettan!! That is a very poisonous snake!”</p>

<p>“She said so too. I don’t know much about snakes or their habitats but she said its because the forest is depleting that the snakes are coming to the cities in search of food.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like an environmentalist. Anyways&hellip; in our town and all it’s a common thing to see snakes. Of course, the forest is nearby. But here&hellip; in the middle of the city…! Who would have thought… Chechy, where did you say your friend saw it?”</p>

<p>“Well, she has been auditing this company which has a lot of branches which implies lots of files. Plus the audit is not for just the previous year alone; its for the last five years… so that makes it lots and lots of files. So their audit manager decided that the articles could stay in the godown itself where the files are stored. Of course they had a separate room, and an office boy who would get them the files. So she said it wasn’t as bad as it sounded. Anyways, yesterday, that is when this incident happened, they asked for some files of an earlier year.
The office boy said it would take some time since the files were stacked towards the end of the godown. After about an hour he comes back with a box and places it in the room.
‘Please start searching in this box if the first file you asked for is in here or not. The index label is missing, so I don’t know what all are inside. But I am sure it is in this box. Meanwhile, I will get the other files.’
Now my friend and the other articles could have asked him to take out the files but they knew that it would get done faster if they searched for it themselves. So they opened the box. It hadn’t been opened for more than three years. There were around ten files or so. They slowly started going through the contents, taking out one file at a time&hellip;”
“Chechy&hellip; the suspense is killing me. Please make the story shorter. Was the snake in the box?”
“Listen, listen. The office boy comes back with another box which is a little bigger than the first one.
‘This box was at the very end. It was very difficult to even get near it. You know there are lots of rats towards that end. Well, nobody has to care about what all trouble I have to go through, right? Everybody’s work gets done; my work just keeps on adding, but not my salary…‘
The offi</p>

<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>

<h3 id="subheading-in-body-copy">Subheading in Body Copy</h3>

<p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
<li>Unordered list item

<ul>
<li>Nested unordered list item</li>
<li>Nested unordered list item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unordered list item</li>
</ul>

<p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.</p>

<h2 id="heading-in-body-copy">Heading in Body Copy</h2>

<p>Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>

<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>
