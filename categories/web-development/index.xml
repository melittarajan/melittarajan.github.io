      <description>It was a snake!”
“What!? Here!? In the city!? A snake!?”
“Yes, she saw it. Said it was a ‘vellikettan’ – a small snake with white stripes across.”
“Vellikettan!! That is a very poisonous snake!”
“She said so too. I don’t know much about snakes or their habitats but she said its because the forest is depleting that the snakes are coming to the cities in search of food.”</description>
