            <p>Do angels come in disguises?</p>

<p>I do not know the answer to that. But what I do know is that the man on the road that day, that stranger, was the angel who saved my life.</p>

<p>It was a normal Friday afternoon, extremely sunny and hot. The air cooling inside the van was working very hard at keeping the heat outside and it did a good job.</p>

<p>I was busy chatting away with Sarah, who was schoolmate and Sunday school mate. Whether I considered her as my friend or not, I don’t remember. But she was a very good person – always caring, always sharing, always smiling. Though I have not been in contact with her since school days, I still remember how kind she was to everyone.</p>

<p>Only one teacher from Sunday school was in our van as all the kids were old enough to get down at their respective stops…. including me.</p>

<p>I don’t remember if I was on a wrong van, but it was going on a different route that day. First stop was our school, but since that is not where I get off usually, I didn’t get off. Next it turned left and stopped only at the ‘H Centre’. Then it kept going and going, stopping in between at places I didn’t know, till the last person to get off the van was – me. Sarah was getting off, so I got out with her.</p>

<p>The van took off. I looked around. The place looked familiar but I had no clue where I was.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/trans.jpg" alt="Drag Racing" /></p>

<p>Sarah looked at me.</p>

<p>“This is my building; where do you stay?”</p>

<p>I was too proud.</p>

<p>“Just around the corner.”</p>

<p>“Ok bye then. See you in school tomorrow.”</p>

<p>And Sarah ran off into her building.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun was unbearable. But I was frozen. I couldn’t move. What had I done? Why had I acted so foolishly? What would I do now? I didn’t know.</p>

<p>I didn’t know. Should I ask someone? I looked around. There were very few people to be seen – it was that time of the day when everybody is indoors, away from the sun.
I should ask someone. But who? How to know whether that someone would be a good or bad person? This thought scared me more than the fact that I was lost.</p>

<p>A few people passed me by; I didn’t dare look at anyone. I was still standing exactly where I had got off the van.</p>

<p>“Are you waiting for someone?”</p>

<p>The question startled me; I almost jumped.</p>

<p>I turned around to see the man.</p>

<p>Not knowing whether to answer or run, I just stared.</p>

<p>“What happened? Where’s your home?”</p>

<p>The mention of home pricked me and I started crying. The man started asking something else but I couldn’t understand a word.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of letting my emotions flow, I think I calmed down a little. I understood what he had been trying to ask me.</p>

<p>“Do you know your home telephone number?”</p>

<p>Yes I did; I knew that I knew it by heart, but at that time my mind was blank.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Another session of crying was about to begin and I think it was very evident on my face because the man immediately said,
“It’s ok, no problem. Don’t worry. We will find your home.”
To this day I don’t know why I trusted him and I trusted him in an instant. Maybe it was his comforting words or the kind voice or maybe it was just my hopelessness which made me trust him – the man on the road.
“What does your building look like? Do you know any shops nearby it?”
“Its near to the school.”
“Oh… really. That’s good. The school is nearby only. If you reach the school you can find your building?”
“Yes, yes.. I can.”
Suddenly I started cooling down on the inside. If I reach the school, then my building is just a bell away.
“Then its this way, let’s go.” The man led the way and we started walking.
I remember him asking some other questions like how I got there, why I was alone, etc., but I don’t remember the answers I gave him because my full focus was on finding my building.
“If it’s the front gate of the school, we need to take this road, otherwise this.”
“Front gate.”
“Okay.. so its this road.”
Walking along the street we turned a left corner and there I looked and behold, I saw it – the only building there with a palm tree - my building.
I ran.
The happiness that burst inside me; no words can explain it. The number of decisions I took in that one minute sprint to my building – no new year resolution can out do that.
Never again will I act foolishly.
Never again will I act like I knew everything.
Never again will I fight with my sisters.
Never again will I disobey my parents.
Never again will I miss my daily prayers.
Never, never, never again.
I never looked back; I was running to the safety of my home. I didn’t think about the man; I only thought about my aching legs and my racing heart.
Up the flight of stairs and ding dong – I rang the doorbell.
It took a few seconds before my dad opened.
“Why were you running?”
I started laughing.
“Simply.”
There was a silly smile on my face the entire day.
I never told my parents about this incident for the fear that they may never allow me to go out alone again. Later I discovered that the place where I got off the van was a street parallel to our street, hardly a five minute walk.
But on that eventful day it had seemed like I was miles and miles away.
I never looked back. So I don’t know what the expression on the man’s face was. Was it of joy that he had been able to help me or was it of scorn that I had never thanked him for his help? I don’t know. I will never know. But I am forever grateful to him.
I don’t remember anything about him – how old he was or what he was wearing that day or what he looked like… nothing. I sometimes think how I could have been so selfish; but given the fact that I was very young, I excuse it.
The kind word, the good deed – the stranger on the road was nothing short of an angel. (Not remembering anything about him makes it easier for me to believe that it was an angel). Because to expect kindness from strangers - human beings – it’s very rare now.
But if I can believe that angels walk on the earth….. then I can believe that there are good people, good strangers… then I can believe that there’s still hope in mankind.</p>
